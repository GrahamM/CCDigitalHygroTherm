Introduction
------------
This contains a basic DHT22 example, that'll transmit temperature and humidity
data in a 'water meter' type packet. You will need to move the pulldown
resistor on the digital dev board, and put a suitable pullup resistor in it's
place.

Roughly every 80 seconds, the device will poll the sensor and transmit the 
result in the form of a water meter counter packet. In order to pair with a
Current Cost base unit, choose a channel on the base unit, and put it in 
pairing mode. Next hold down the button on the digital dev board until the LED
starts flashing, which is about 5 or 6 seconds. The digital dev board unit 
will stay in pairing mode for approximately 12 seconds.

Battery life should be pretty good. I have one sensor that has been running
for about a year on the same set of AA batteries.

See EnviR Output to understand how the sensor values are transmitted, and how
to intepret the output from the EnviR.

EEPROM use
----------
The code uses the first two memory locations in EEPROM to store the device
address.

Precompiled HEX
---------------
If all you need is a hex file, there is a precompiled .hex file in dist/default/production.

EnviR Output
------------
The output from the EnviR should be something like:
<msg><src>CC128-v1.29</src><dsb>00759</dsb><time>19:09:09</time><tmpr>20.7</tmpr><sensor>8</sensor><id>12345</id><type>4</type><imp>0989912344</imp><ipu>0001</ipu></msg>

The <imp> value is a combination of temperature and humidity. The first 16
bits of the value are the temperature in 0.1 of a degree C. The next 8 bits
are the humidity in %. The last 8 bits are a checksum. This checksum should
have the same value as the adding together the most significat three bytes
and ANDing with 0xFF.

Notes
-----
This was built using a 'framework' I'd written to make it easier to produce
code that could interface with Current Cost "C2" equipment.
